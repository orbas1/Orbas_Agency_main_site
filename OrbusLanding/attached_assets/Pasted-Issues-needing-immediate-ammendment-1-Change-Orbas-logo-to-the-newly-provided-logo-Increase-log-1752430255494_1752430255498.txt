Also you need to sort out the hero image in the hero section fully I have supplied one for you . I have also supplied several pictures for the body of the website too .

Redesign the hero section to accommodate so itâ€™s all super professional also your website links are not working !

Crop and redesign any of the body pics so they are suitable and tint slightly so they all match the colour scheme
