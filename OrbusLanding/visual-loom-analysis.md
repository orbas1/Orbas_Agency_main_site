# Visual Loom Experience Audit

## Executive Summary
The existing Orbas landing experience already communicates innovation through gradients, motion canvases and high-energy photography. In its current form the "visual loom"—the orchestration of motion, hierarchy and storytelling—earns a **B+ (8.2/10)**. The hero establishes intrigue, yet the supporting layers can better project enterprise rigor.

## Strengths
- **Immersive hero treatment** with animated constellations and an aspirational tone.
- **Consistent colour language** across platforms, retaining recognisable Orbas hues.
- **Robust platform cards** that articulate value and maintain visual parity.
- **Data orb illustration** adds an advanced motion cue that hints at orchestration.

## Gaps Preventing a 10/10
1. **Information hierarchy drift** – Long paragraphs and similar card heights reduce scannability for executives who skim for proof-points.
2. **Trust signalling** – Enterprise buyers expect uptime, compliance and scale metrics positioned near CTAs.
3. **Micro-interaction depth** – Motion is concentrated in canvases; core UI components feel static.
4. **System guardrails** – There is limited articulation of the design principles that guide the experience.

## Experience Objectives for Enterprise Grade
| Objective | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
|Establish proof|Surface quantified outcomes (deployments, satisfaction, uptime) in the hero state.|Builds credibility for C-suite reviewers in under 5 seconds.|
|Show design system thinking|Introduce principles, spacing rhythm and accessibility commitments.|Demonstrates maturity and scalability.|
|Add purposeful motion|Counters, parallax tilts and responsive glow states create tactile feedback.|Signals craftsmanship and attention to detail.|
|Narrate the vision|Summarise audit findings and the north-star experience to align stakeholders.|Provides clarity for product, marketing and leadership.|

## What Changed in this Iteration
- **Hero trust layer** – Animated counters and a visual diagnostic that defines the current grade and path to 10/10.
- **Enterprise design north star** – Highlights the pillars that will guide future surfaces.
- **Experience principles section** – Codifies three pillars (clarity, confidence, delight) for repeatable execution.
- **Motion enhancements** – Introduced a parallax tilt for hero imagery and counter animations respecting reduced-motion preferences.

## Next Recommendations
1. Evolve a full design system inventory (tokens, components, pattern documentation) with Figma-to-code parity.
2. Integrate customer testimonials and compliance badges dynamically from a CMS to keep proof-points fresh.
3. Expand accessibility testing (contrast audits, keyboard trap sweeps, screen reader narratives) before public release.
4. Capture motion guidelines (duration, easing, triggers) so the experience feels cohesive beyond the landing page.

With these layers in place, Orbas can confidently deliver a **10/10 visual loom** that aligns with enterprise expectations and differentiates the brand.
